So in this course we've seen a lot of examples of artificial intelligence and
we've explored some of the underlying technologies and techniques that it
relies on the AI is built on data science and machine learning and there
are a huge number of tools the data scientists use to explore and process
and model data deploying and maintaining a working environment that includes all
of the tools that a data  scientist might use can be really challenging and
time-consuming so the Microsoft data science virtual machine in Azure is a
really good way to provision a data science workstation and get all the
tools you need without having to spend ages installing and maintaining
everything to deploy the data science virtual machine I'm gonna go to my Azure
portal here and in my subscription I'm gonna add a new resource now you can
see I've already got it on my short list here but if you're you're looking
for it you can just simply search for a data science virtual machine and in the
list of results from that you'll see there are various different flavors of
that data science virtual machine there's a version that run on Windows
and there are versions that run on Linux and there are also versions and
different versions of Windows so you can you can pick and choose whichever one is
the right one for you I'm gonna go with the basic data science virtual
machine for Windows option here and I get a description of everything that's
included in that tool and there's a whole bunch of tools in the virtual
machine that are going to be useful if you're working with data and building
predictive and machine learning models so I'm gonna go ahead and create and we
get the usual Azure kind of approach to making a resource we've got a bunch of
settings if we need to provide so I'll provide my virtual machine with a name
I'll just call mine dsvm01 and there we'll get a little confirmation
there - a little green tick of happiness tells me that's okay I can choose the
disk type I can use solid state or traditional hard disks I'll
stick with solid state because it'll give me a better performance
I give a username for logging on to the machine it's just literally
going to create a virtual machine with a username that I need to log on with so
whatever user name I'll just give it my name and then some sort of password and
there are some password requirements and needs to be a reasonably complex
password and we'll just confirm that password there as well and this is the
subscription that I'm currently using we're just gonna add this virtual
machine to that subscription and we'll create a resource group for it so we'll
call the dsvm-rg and i can choose whichever location i want to deploy this
and i'm quite happy with west US so i'll just go ahead and click OK and now I
need to choose the size of the virtual machine and this will
control how much it's gonna cost to run this virtual machine whenever it's
running we'll be charging against AI so you can see that to run this this is in
and British pounds and that's per month for that standard size I'm really only
just experimenting with this I don't really need anything quite as expensive
as that so I'm gonna view all and when I view all I can see some other options
there and there's a sort of less expensive one here just for the purpose
of taking a look at the machine and seeing what's on it you can choose
whichever is right for you and that you'll get an indication of how much it
will cost to run that so go ahead and select that option and then I can set up
various optional features for this I'm not gonna bother with any of these for
this example but you could set up a an availability set to give you a high
availability it's already configured a virtual network and so on for me so all
the bits and pieces I need are really pretty much there I'll click OK and then
I get a final page of confirmation ready to go I agree to the Terms of Use and I
can go and purchase that virtual machine and off that's gonna go and provision
the virtual machine and it'll take five to ten minutes to get that
provisioned so we'll just wait from that to complete.. and when the deployment has
completed we get our virtual machine here and the various options to stop or
pause or whatever I need to do with that machine here
the one I'm really concerned about here is connecting so I'm gonna go and
connect and this is a Windows virtual machine so I'm gonna use a remote
desktop program to connect to it and we're just go and connect and it's asked me
to log in and it's using the credentials I'm currently logged into my local
Windows machine here so I'm just going to change it to use the account that I
configured when I provisioned the machine so we'll just put in our
username and password and we get a little warning about not been able to
verify the identity of the computer I'm happy enough with that I've just
provisioned it so I'm ok with that so we'll see yes we want to connect and
we get our Remote Desktop session starting and I'm now connected to my
data science virtual machine and when it starts I get a little thing about
do I want to make the network public here I'll just say no to that and here I
am at the desktop on my data science virtual machine and you can see that are a
number of shortcuts on the desktop here for the tools that have been installed
so we've got things like visual studio code and the full version of visual
studio here we've got Spyder which is a graphical environment for working with
Python we've we've got SQL Server tools installed in here we've got our
studio if you want to program in our to work with data you can do that
we've got Jupyter notebooks which ow we've been using in this course and it's
installed locally under the data science virtual machine ready for you to work so
there's a number of things already there for me to start using and work with my
data in this environment without me having to go through the the the pain of
having to install and configure all of those tools myself so one of the things
that you might want to do is get started with the data science virtual machine and
there is in fact a shortcut on the desktop entitled exactly that so if we
go and open that up our browser and I get a little warning because it's the
first time I've used the browser or so we'll just use the recommended settings
there and you can see the is a list of 10 things we can do on the
data science virtual machine so you can get started getting to know the tools
that are on here and how you might use them to get started working with data
science tasks or building machine learning models so we're not going to go
into the details of all of the tools that are on here in this course but we
really just wanted to make sure that you're aware that the data science
virtual machine is there it can save you a lot of time setting up the environment
and you can of course just spin it up and use it when you need it
and then delete it when you're finished with it and only pay for what you use
