In this course we've explored some of the fundamental principles and use cases
for artificial intelligence but we've really only scratched the surface of the
subject AI is a fast-moving area with new advances being made every day and as
a growing need for AI engineering expertise to research deep learning
predictive modeling techniques and to develop new AI solutions that drive the
state-of-the-art forward in this lesson we'll introduce some of the advanced
tools and frameworks that you can use to go beyond basic statistical machine
learning and experiment with deep learning techniques and we'll point out
some resources that you can use to learn more.
