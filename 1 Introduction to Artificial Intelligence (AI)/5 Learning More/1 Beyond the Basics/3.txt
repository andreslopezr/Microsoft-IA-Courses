At the beginning of this course we explored some statistical machine
learning techniques and you've seen how they can be used to create effective
predictive models however we're continuing to develop new more powerful
machine learning techniques that take advantage of increased computer
processing power and new algorithms for deep learning such as convolutional
neural networks and reinforcement learning the Microsoft cognitive toolkit
provides data scientists in AI engineers with a powerful set of libraries for
building deep learning models to take advantage of the cognitive toolkit you
can come to the cognitive toolkit website and install it locally on your
computer and then there are some tutorials and documentation you can use
to get started alternatively you can go to Azure
notebooks and it supports the cognitive toolkit out-of-the-box there's an
environment there where you can run cognitive toolkit code and there are the
same tutorials available there so you can open up these tutorials and learn
how to use the cognitive toolkit to do deep learning or alternatively if you
have the data science virtual machine the cognitive toolkit is installed on
there and if I open up Jupyter notebook here I can see that there's a CNTK
samples folder that contains tutorials and there I've got those same tutorial
notebooks as well so there's there's multiple ways in which you can use the
cognitive toolkit now why would you want to use the cognitive toolkit we've seen
that we can use tools like Azure machine learning to build machine
learning models the beauty of the cognitive toolkit is it's designed to
take advantage of multiple CPUs or even GPUs to work with huge volumes of data
and dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to train models based on
that data and build a machine learning solutions it's a great platform for
working with what we call deep learning techniques and deep learning techniques
are generally based on trying to mimic the way that human brains operate when
processing data so we have this concept of a neuron we build a neural network
and each neuron has multiple inputs which have different weights associated
with them we then calculate a value based on the
and based on those weights to give us a value between zero and one that
determines whether this neuron is activated or fires and then we can chain
these things together as a network of neurons and build very sophisticated
learning models that operate on on very complex problems so if you want to go
further with machine learning and learn how to use these deep learning
techniques the cognitive toolkit is a great platform for enabling you to do
that and you can do that in any of these different toolsets that we've talked
about in this course
