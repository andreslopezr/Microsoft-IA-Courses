AI is not the future anymore, it's here.
We can use it.
"Hi Ariel, you have two urgent messages."
"It will take you two minutes to complete."
We developers need to follow the stream.
We need to develop what people need.
You push a button and publish that skill on
Cortana's skill store, and it's boom available.
It's phenomenal.
Cortana has the kind of reach that no other platform has.
You've got millions of devices and user that are leveraging
Cortana to do their day-to-day job.
Technology-wise and support-wise it is really amazing right now.
By partnering with Microsoft, there's nothing more which a
small company can dream about.
Cortana is unique in the way that it's a hybrid platform.
You get a visual experience and it engages all the senses.
When using Bot Framework you are writing the code once.
You can now publish it to many different channels.
Microsoft understand developers and technology.
If they're happy building on your platform they can focus on
the things that they're really good at.
It's very easy to go from an idea,
to building a Cortana skill
very, very quickly.
Voice recognition, natural language processing,
this is all on the cutting edge.
It's good to be here early learning about it together
with our partners.
What really excited me about this partnership is the ability
to take this dream and make it a reality.
It's all just a new space that we're all learning and growing
in, and Cortana skills will continue to evolve and I'm
really excited to see where it's going to go.
