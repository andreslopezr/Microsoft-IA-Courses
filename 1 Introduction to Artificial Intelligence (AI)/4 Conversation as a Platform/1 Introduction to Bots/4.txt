So we've seen how to create a simple bot using the Bot framework and we're ready
now to try and use that through various different channels so here's my shouty
bot that we created previously and we've already had a look actually at the web
chat channel where I can get the code to embed that bot into a web page
there's a whole bunch of other channels l could use as well - there are
channels for things like Cortana or for Microsoft Teams or Skype or Bing or even
by email so I could use any of these options here to create a way for users
to communicate with my bot in the way that they would communicate with with
other people, like for example by sending a Skype message or making a call
