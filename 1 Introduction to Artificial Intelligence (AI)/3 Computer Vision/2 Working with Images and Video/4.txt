So up till now we've considered how to work with static images and there's a
lot that we can do with that however the world is in motion and video is becoming
a more prevalent media format on the web and in general here's a short video of
our robot kicking a ball now in reality this video is really just a stream of
static images known as frames and they're encoded in a format specific
codec and encapsulated in a container which also includes a header with
metadata about the format duration and so on now to take a look at working with
some videos we're just going to run some very simple Python code that is gonna
grab a video play it and take a look at the frames that are in so let's take a
look at that I'm here in my Jupyter notebook and I'm gonna first of all
install this library called AV and that's really just gonna help me work
with with video file so we get that installed and with that package
installed we can now start to do some stuff with videos and I'm gonna grab a
little video file it's a very small video file that we use for intros
and outros to videos in these types of training courses so I'm gonna grab that
and download that locally and once I've got that downloaded we'll just play it
in here so that we can see what it looks like and it's a very small video that
basically just shows the Microsoft logo being animated like that okay so that's
our video we've got that downloaded let's take a look and particularly what
frames are in there so I'm gonna use the AV package and I'm going to open up that
video and then all I'm really gonna do is go into the container remember that
the videos are contained within the container so we're go into the container
and we'll add decode the first of the video codecs that we find in there so
we'll grab that video codec that will give us the frames and we're just going
to go through for each frame that we find in that we're gonna check to see if
the index is number 25 so in other words before trying to find the 25th frame in
the video if we find out then we're gonna just
take that frame and convert it to an image just so that we can see what that
frame looks like and display that but otherwise we're just gonna keep counting
through the frames and then once we get to the end of that list of frames we'll
take the freemen day it's the one that we're currently at and we'll subtract
one because the frame indexes start at zero so we'll subtract one and that
should tell us how many frames were in the video now obviously this is a very
small video so that'll work for a larger video this is probably not the most
efficient way to count the frames in it but you can see that when I run that
it's able to run through it finds 111 frames in the video and this is what the
25th frame looks like we've got this image here so from this little demo
here you can see really that a video is a container that contains a codec and I
could it contains that the frames for the video and that we're able to go and
separate those frames out and frame the individual frames and display them as
images and that's really going to be the basis of a lot of the work we're going
to do with that with videos
