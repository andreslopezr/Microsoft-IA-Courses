video indexer is a cognitive service that brings together many of the AI
capabilities we've seen so far in this course it's a great example of how AI
can help automate time-consuming tasks like compiling and editing the metadata
for video files so here is what the video indexer UI looks like I've logged
into the service and I have already uploaded a video this is a video
just taking an extract from one of the other courses that we we offer here and
I've uploaded that and I haven't done anything to it other than upload it so
if I go ahead and play it from here I
can actually see some insights appearing over here on the left so it's
automatically edited this I'm just gonna stop that and mute my volume so
we're not interrupted by that but you can hear that it's a video is playing
quite happily there and here's what the video looks like here over on the
right-hand side you can see that there are the people in here so identified two
different faces so it says there's that person and that person well this
person here is my colleague Liberty so we'll just go and tell it that's the
right name and this one here is me so we'll just go and tell it that's me as
well
but it has at least identified the faces in there for me so and now now I've told
who those are those faces are it's also picked up some keywords it's picked up
that this is from a stats course it's of course about statistics and it's picked
up the keyword "statistical underlying methodologies" and it's picked up some
sentiment from here so overwhelmingly if it analyzes all of the text in the video
it's positive about 53 percent of the time in neutral about 47 percent of
the time so so a reasonably positive video and I can jump to the bit of the
video using these keywords here I can jump to the keyword where we talk about
statistical underlying methodologies or to the bit where I talk about stats
course so it's able to pick up those keywords as being important and let me
jump straight to them in the video and I can also if I scroll the top here as
well as looking at the people I can see that it's automatically generated a
transcript for that video so I can see the transcript is generated and you'll
notice that that includes this OCR is picked up the right at the beginning of
if I click on that you can actually see it's got our names down here at the
bottom of the video and it's picked that up it's read the OCR - it's used the
optical character recognition rather to read that data and show me that that
appears on the screen so it's got some pretty clever stuff of going through and
generating that transcript and so on and it's generated that in English I
could in fact just go and tell it that I would like to have that transcript in
French and it will go and automatically translate that into French for me so a
lot of the work that would be involved in working with a video and adding
metadata to it has been done for me I can also a search throughout the video
so I could search for the word data and of course it's searching in French at
the moment so if we search in English for data let's try that it finds the
locations where data appears in the transcripts and I can go and jump to
that bit of the video automatically so I'm getting a really rich experience
because the the AI service has been able to analyze that video and I can go and
edit the insights that get phoned from here so I can see the the the different
transcript in here I can go in and edit that transcript so I can see "it's not a
fool on stats course" I wasn't really what I meant when I said
that so I could go and edit that and say "it's not a full-on stats course" and we
just make that change so I can go and edit that on the fly and then I
could go and publish this video and make available and use all these insights to
let people navigate through and find things in a video and all of this is
available both in this a user interface and also as an API so I could I could
write a piece of code that uploads a video automatically gets these insights
generated and then downloads the the insights that get generated and is able
to analyze those so a pretty impressive use of artificial intelligence to take a
look at video and audio and do some text analytics and do all sorts of
interesting things that we've looked at in this course in order to make life
easier for somebody who needs to manage lots of video files
