So edge detectors use gradients to find contrast and pixel intensity when a mask
is moved horizontally or vertically however to detect corners in an image
you need to detect contrast in intensity in any direction the harris corner
detector algorithm works by testing patches of the image the patch is moved
in multiple directions and the pixel intensity is compared for each position
now in a featureless area of the image there's no significant difference so no
corner is detected now let's try the patch in an area that contains an edge
in this case there is a difference in intensity when the patch is moved in one
direction but not when moved along the edge so again there's no corner here now
let's position the patch in an area containing a corner a movement in any
direction results in a change of intensity so this looks like it might be
a corner now the formula that underlies the Harris algorithm is a little
involved it uses a little calculus and some matrix math but there are
implementations of this algorithm in many languages including Python so let's
take a look and what I've got is a function here that I've defined called
corner_harr and I'm going to specify an image and a minimum distance and really
the important thing here is from the the skimage library I'm importing the
corner_harris which obviously applies the algorithm for finding corners and
also something called corner_eaks and I'm really gonna use that just to kind
of filter out all of the the kind of corners of lower magnitude so I'm left
with the more prominent corners that are identified in my image so we'll go ahead
and work our way through the image and then filter it was based on the distance
that I've specified so the size of the corners now what I'm going to do here is
is just simply pass in my equalized image remember I equalized the
grayscale image earlier on will pass that in and then we're going to plot the
results and we get back that that Harris result we're basically going to plot the
image and we're gonna on top of that plot the corners
that were detected by the the Harris algorithm so we'll just plot those as
little red markers so that we can see where the coroners are so let's go ahead
and run that and you can see that what actually comes back with the most
prominent corners that have find are around the eyes we're obviously there's
a corner as the corner of the eye meets the face and it's picked those out quite
prominently so you can see that when it comes to looking at something like a
human face this corner detection algorithm is actually very useful for
finding that type of thing and of course it's useful in any other situation where
you particularly want to find the corners of things so again we've seen
that because our image is actually just an array of numbers we were able to
apply these mathematical formulae and algorithms to in order to extract
features and discern some sort of meaning from the images and that's
really what AI technologies are going to do when they're processing images
