Now because an image is actually an array of numeric values the distribution
of these values can tell you something about the range of colors or shades the
image contains or the objects that are in it you can plot these as a histogram
to see the distribution of values and you can also use a cumulative
distribution function to see how the pixel values accumulate each point on
the y axis shows the frequency of all the values up to and including the value
on the x axis now for image processing is usually good to have a relatively
even distribution of pixel values a markedly uneven distribution can
indicate there are extremes of contrast in the image that need to be equalized
so you can normalize an image to equalize pixel distribution and the CDF
for a perfectly equalized image is basically a straight diagonal line let's
take a look at examples of normalizing an image using Python and the first
thing I'm going to do in my Jupyter notebook here is I'm going to create a
histogram with 256 bins so and for all of the the different possible values in
my my pixel intensities and what we'll just create a histogram so that we can
see what the distribution of those values looks like and here's the the
distribution of those values so if we're going to remind ourselves here's the
image and here's what the distribution of the different kind of shades of gray
in that image are looked like so they're kind of peaking around here there's a
peak at the beginning then there's another peak in the middle and it's a
little bit kind of up and down it's really uneven that distribution now
another thing we can do is we can use this cumulative distribution function a
CDF and basically that just shows me that the distribution for all the values
up to this point so I get a kind of cumulative view of there
the values so we're go ahead and run that and in a perfectly and normalized
image that would be a perfectly straight diagonal line and you can see that it's
not it's kind of bumping up here and it's got some curves at the ends and so
on so we have a fairly unevenly distributed
of values in that distribution of pixel values and what I might want to do in
order just to simplify processing of that I might want to equalize it
that unevenness at the moment might indicate that there are some issues with
contrast in the in the video so I might want to equalize out the contrast and
and try and get a I'm working a simple set of numbers to work with
so to do that I've got this function here so let's go ahead and run that and
here's what the equalized image looks like you can see actually the contrast
has been raised a bit so we've got a really kind of bright and center bit
here and and it's a bit more even in tone and if I go and have a look at that
as the histogram or the CDF what we should see is well there's still some
spikes here but I can see it's much more kind of level in the middle here so it's
a more kind of equal distribution of values across there and I have a more or
less diagonal straight line for my CDF so I've certainly equalized out the
values in the histogram and that may well make it easier for me to work with
those values and try and extract some features
