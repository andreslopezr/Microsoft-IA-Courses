After you've prepared an image you can extract features from it using a variety
of techniques so for example you could use an edge detection algorithm to find
contrasting edges of color or intensity they often indicate the boundaries of
shapes or objects in the image so for example the Sobel edge detection
algorithm works by convolving an operation over the image similar to
Gaussian a median filters that you saw previously however this time the matrix
that we apply is a two-stage masking function that is applied to the pixel
intensity values in the image to calculate a gradient value based on
changes in intensity this mask is apply to find the horizontal gradient for each
pixel let's call it Gx and then this mask is applied to detect the vertical
gradients which we'll call Gy we then add the squares of the x and y gradient
values that are calculated for each pixel and we take the square root to
determine a gradient value for each pixel and we can calculate the inverse
tangent of those values to determine the angle of the edges that have been
detected so here's my Python code and I'm just creating a function called edge_sobel
passing in the image and all I'm doing with this is I first of all am
converting it to grayscale and as it happens my image is already in grayscale
but it's the Sobel edge detection only really works properly with with
grayscale images and not one dimension so we'll convert it to grayscale just in
case and then we're gonna take our horizontal pass through and get the
horizontal edges and then we will do the vertical pass through so remember
there's these two passes to get the X and y of the edges and then we apply
this hypotenuse function here and to basically add the squares of those and
take the square root to get the the actual magnitude of the the the
different edges that are found and then we're going to apply this function here
to normalize that and then I can now return that back and display those edges
in my image so we'll go ahead and run that code and here's what it finds sure
enough it goes through the image and it detect
at the edge of the jacket and around the the head and particularly around the
eyes actually we can see there's a lot of different edges that is detected
there but there's light and shade going on and the mouth and the nose so
we we're actually able to go and detect reasonably sophisticated edges in that
image just by applying that particular Sobel algorithm so we're able to work
with the fact that the image is really just numbers and from that we're able to
go and grab these features and extract them so that we can work with them in
the image
