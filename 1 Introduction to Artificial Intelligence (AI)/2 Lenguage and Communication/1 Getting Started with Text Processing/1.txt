As humans, we've evolved to be the intelligent problem solvers
that we are by communicating through written and
spoken language.
Communication is key to successful collaboration.
So artificial intelligence needs to include the ability to
communicate naturally with digital entities.
Software needs to be able to understand text,
extracting semantic meaning, and
even sentiment from the language that we use as humans.
And we also need to be able to speak to AI agents and have them
respond appropriately even engaging us in conversation.
So in this lesson, we'll take a look at how we can process text
and speech to enable AI for language and communication.
