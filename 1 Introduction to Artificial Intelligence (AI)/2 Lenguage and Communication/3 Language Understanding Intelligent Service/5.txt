So think about this.
How often are you alive when the dawn of a new medium comes out?
I knew that I had to be a part of VR because there are no rules for
what VR should be.
Starship Commander is a choose your own adventure VR narrative
that uses natural language processing.
So you can actually have a real conversation with the characters.
>> I'm Sergeant Sarah Pearson.
I've been assigned to your wing today.
>> When we started making Starship Commander, we had to figure out,
how do we get technology that can understand what a person is saying.
So that we can have these new narrative experiences.
We're science fiction game.
We come up with new words.
No off the shelf software could let us put in custom words.
>> Who are the Ecknians?
>> In our story, the bad guys are called the Ecknians.
Every time we said Ecknian, you would come up with
really weird words that were similar to other things that you would say.
And so I would get confused all the time, so
we needed to make sure that we could supply our own script.
We started using Microsoft Cognitive Services to power the backend of
Starship Commander.
>> Looks cool.
>> Once we plugged custom speech service into Starship Commander,
I had tears in my eyes when I was playing it because it's like-
>> My god.
>> My god, this is it, this is the experience we want.
>> Open the hatch.
>> Voice print accepted.
Welcome, commander.
>> You can essentially put your script in there and
it knows, these are the ways that people are gonna talk, and
these are the phrases that they're gonna say.
>> Cool, what's my mission?
>> Must be something pretty important.
>> And then the second thing too was the intent detection.
With Luis, you basically give it a couple of statements.
After you've given it a couple statements,
you crunch it, and you start typing in your own statements.
And it's shockingly scary
how good it picks up even stuff that you didn't put in there.
>> Computer, use autopilot and let's be on our way.
>> Autopilot engaging.

>> I've never seen an opportunity like this.
Where there's a wide open playing field,
no one's written the rules yet.
There's gonna be tons of amazing software out there and
I just can't wait to see what other people write.
